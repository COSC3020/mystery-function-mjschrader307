# Mystery Function

What does the `mystery()` function in the following piece of code do? Add your
answer to this markdown file.

```javascript
function mystery(a) {
  if (a.length == 1) return a[0];

  var foo = mystery(a.slice(1, a.length));

  if (foo > a[0]) return foo;
  else return a[0];
}
```

This is a recursive function that takes in some array, a.

The first if-statement is the base case, which returns the first element of the argument array if it
consists of only one element.

The recursive case of this function involves passing in a sub-array of the original into
the function.

The array is broken down until the function operates on individual elements. `foo` should represent the maximum value. If `foo` is greater than the argument array's first element, the function returns `foo`. Otherwise, it returns the first element.

It seems that this function is designed to look for the maximum value of the array. It does this by comparing the previous first element with the first element of the newly-broken-down array
